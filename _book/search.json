Show the diffence on whip_char'and show it for the sixmilk-labs` you recoded.\nSave the plot on your computer as a png-file. Here is place in a projectmap and a submap images which I made on my computer. Change the path if necessary for your computer.\nFor counting frequencies you always can use different methods. We show some of them.\nThis is the R base-way for counting the variable whipfor example.\nThis is the grouping-way.\nThis is a better way (thanks Wim!).\nHere we do some basic cleaning. We select six variables and look only at variables of which the size is grande. We call this dataset star_clean.\nLet us plot it on different ways.The first three are similar.\nThen we plot the coffee of which the whipis 1.\nFor the next plot we first change the class of the variable milk into a character variable and save it as a different dataset.\nWe plot this new dataset on three different ways."
